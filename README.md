# MotorcycleRacingClub

My first application made as semester thesis in the first year of studying at university.
It is a fairly simple, but it achieves the basic CRUD principles, working with linked lists,sorting by a certain parameter and has the ability to store and retrieve data from external files.
Each feature will be described below.

Working with files
------

- Menu for working with files
A list of file processing functions is presented in this menu.

- File creation
Through this function the user creates a new file, assigning it an individual name, and adding the necessary data to it.

- Add to file
Introduces at the end of the file, a number of new data chosen by the user. This function appeals to the previous one which allows the simplification of the program.

- Display
The display takes the data from the file, the name of which is indicated by the user, and displays it in the console.

- Split into 2 files
Divides the data from the initial file and sorts them according to the even / odd principle of the participant's race number.

- Modify
Allows the user to change the data about the participant by indicating his number according to the list.

- Selective display
The selective display contains a small menu from which the user can choose the number of participants who finished among the first.

- Sorting
 Arranges (according to the Shell algorithm) the data in ascending order according to the number of finishes to highlight the order in which the participants finished.

Working with linked lists
------
- Menu for working with lists
Like the file menu, the list menu offers the ability to choose and work with lists

- Create
It forms a new list in which the user enters the required data. They are added before the list.

- Display
When selecting the display option, the data entered in the list is demonstrated to the user.

- Adding
The add option uses the number indicated by the user to determine the position and insert 2 new items inside the list.

- Delete
Like addition, the delete excludes the following 2 numbers from the list according to the one indicated.
